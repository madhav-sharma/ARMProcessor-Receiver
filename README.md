# ARMProcessor-Receiver

This C program can run on an arm processor to decode a signal transmitted from NIST in Colorado,
given an antenna tuned to the right frequency. The program uses signal processing methods to decode
the signal with reliability.

Developed under the guidance of Prof. Wayne Stark.
